# GolangChiaProofofSpace

Chia's proof of space demonstration has been implemented in the Go programming language (Golang). The implementation consists of a plotter, prover, and verifier, all written in Golang. To enhance performance, Goroutines have been employed, allowing for concurrent execution and thus faster processing.

 The main focus of this code is the Plotting Algorithm, which has provided me with a great learning experience. Through its implementation, I have gained valuable insights and expanded my knowledge in various areas. This code has been instrumental in enhancing my understanding of efficient plotting techniques and their impact on overall performance.
